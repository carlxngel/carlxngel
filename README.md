## 🎯 About Me

I’m a spanish junior professional with a strong background in user-centered design and data analysis. I hold a Master’s degree in UX/UI, where I developed key skills in user research, intuitive interface design, and creating digital experiences focused on people. I complemented my profile with a bootcamp in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence, which has allowed me to integrate data insights and emerging technologies into the design process.

- 🤖 Designing experiences based on user needs, behaviors, and feedback through research and usability testing.
- 🔄 Creating low- to high-fidelity wireframes and interactive prototypes.
- 📊 Transforming complex data into actionable business insights.
- 🧠Applying basic data analysis and visualization to inform design decisions, using tools like Python.
- 🚀 Working in cross-functional teams, communicating decisions clearly, and receiving feedback constructively.
